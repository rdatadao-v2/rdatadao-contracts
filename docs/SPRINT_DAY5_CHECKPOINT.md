## 🔄 Critical Decisions Made

1. **Fixed Supply Forever**
   - 100M tokens minted at deployment
   - No minting capability exists
   - Simplifies security and governance

2. **Modular Rewards Architecture**
   - StakingPositions: Immutable core
   - RewardsManager: Upgradeable orchestrator
   - Reward Modules: Pluggable components

3. **Honest Documentation**
   - Removed false claims about minting
   - Clarified off-chain governance reality
   - Documented stub VRC-20 implementation

4. **Conservative Migration**
   - 3%→2%→1% incentives over 12 weeks
   - Prevents week 1 rush
   - Sustainable approach
