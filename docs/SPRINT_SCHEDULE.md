# 📅 RDAT V2 Smart Contract Development Sprint Schedule

**Sprint Duration**: August 5-18, 2025 (13 days)  
**Team Focus**: Smart Contract Development Stream  
**Audit Target**: August 12-13, 2025  
**Framework**: Foundry/Forge  
**Deliverables**: 11 Core Contracts (Modular Architecture) + Full Test Coverage  
**Architecture**: Triple-layer design (Token + NFT Staking + Rewards)

## ⚡ Schedule Updates
**Day 2 (August 6)**: Added upgradeability pattern (UUPS) and CREATE2 factory per user request. This work was originally planned for later but was pulled forward to ensure all contracts follow the upgradeable pattern from the start.

**Day 3 (August 6)**: Major architecture pivot - chose StakingPositions (NFT-based) over StakingManager for better UX. Implemented conditional transfer logic to prevent zombie positions where NFT and vRDAT are in different wallets. Reduced total contracts from 14 to 11.
