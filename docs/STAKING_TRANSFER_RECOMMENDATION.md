# üéØ StakingPositions Transfer Recommendation

**Date**: August 6, 2025  
**Decision**: Implement Conditional Transfer (GMX-style)  
**Rationale**: Prevent zombie positions while maintaining user protection

---

## The Problem

Current issue with NFT transfers and soul-bound vRDAT:
1. User stakes RDAT ‚Üí receives Position NFT + vRDAT tokens
2. User transfers NFT to new wallet
3. New wallet owns position but original wallet has vRDAT
4. New wallet can't emergency exit (no vRDAT to burn)
5. Position becomes "zombie" - locked forever

---

## Recommended Solution: Conditional Transfer

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Strict Protection** (Recommended for V2 Beta)
```solidity
function _update(address to, uint256 tokenId, address auth) internal override {
    address from = _ownerOf(tokenId);
    
    if (from != address(0) && to != address(0)) {
        // Check 1: Must be unlocked
        if (!canUnstake(tokenId)) revert TransferWhileLocked();
        
        // Check 2: No active vRDAT rewards
        Position memory pos = _positions[tokenId];
        if (pos.vrdatMinted > 0) {
            revert TransferWithActiveRewards(
                "Emergency exit required before transfer"
            );
        }
    }
    
    return super._update(to, tokenId, auth);
}
```

### User Experience

**Scenario 1: Normal Transfer (After Unlock)**
1. User waits for lock period to end
2. User unstakes normally (burns vRDAT, gets RDAT)
3. NFT burns automatically
4. No transfer needed

**Scenario 2: Early Transfer Need**
1. User needs to transfer before unlock
2. System shows: "Position has X vRDAT that must be burned"
3. User calls `emergencyWithdraw()` (50% penalty, burns vRDAT)
4. Position marked as "emergency exited"
5. NFT becomes transferable

**Scenario 3: Lost Access Recovery**
1. User loses access to wallet with vRDAT
2. Position is effectively locked forever
3. This is by design - same as losing private keys

## Why This Approach

### ‚úÖ Pros
1. **No Zombie Positions**: Can't create untouchable positions
2. **User Protection**: Can't accidentally lose rewards
3. **Clean Mental Model**: "Exit fully before transfer"
4. **Battle-tested**: Similar to GMX and Synthetix
5. **Simple Implementation**: Minimal code changes

### ‚ùå Cons
1. **No Secondary Market**: Can't sell locked positions
2. **Less Flexibility**: Two-step process for transfers
3. **Emergency Exit Required**: 50% penalty to transfer early

---

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. ‚ùå Burn on Transfer (Platypus-style)
- Automatically burn vRDAT when transferring
- **Problem**: Creates zombie positions if user lacks vRDAT

### 2. ‚ùå Permanently Non-transferable (Curve-style)
- No NFT transfers at all
- **Problem**: No flexibility, can't move between wallets

### 3. ‚ùå Liquid Wrapper (Convex-style)
- Wrap positions in transferable tokens
- **Problem**: Added complexity, breaks direct ownership

### 4. ‚ùå Migration Function
- Special function to move position + vRDAT
- **Problem**: Breaks vRDAT soul-bound property

---

## Implementation Checklist

### Required Changes:
1. ‚úÖ Update `_update()` function to check vRDAT
2. ‚úÖ Add `TransferWithActiveRewards` error
3. ‚úÖ Add `emergencyUnlocked` flag to Position struct
4. ‚úÖ Update `emergencyWithdraw()` to set flag
5. ‚úÖ Add clear error messages for users

### Testing Required:
1. Test transfer blocks with active vRDAT
2. Test emergency exit flow
3. Test transfer after emergency exit
4. Test normal unstake flow unchanged
5. Test edge cases (0 vRDAT, etc.)

### Documentation:
1. Update user guide with transfer rules
2. Add FAQ about soul-bound rewards
3. Create UI warnings for transfer attempts
4. Document emergency exit process

---

## Future Flexibility

Add DAO-controllable transfer mode:
```solidity
bool public strictTransferMode = true; // Can be changed by governance

function setTransferMode(bool strict) external onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) {
    strictTransferMode = strict;
    emit TransferModeUpdated(strict);
}
```

This allows future governance to relax rules if community desires.

## Final Recommendation

**Implement Conditional Transfer with emergency exit requirement**. This:
- Protects users from creating zombie positions
- Maintains soul-bound properties of vRDAT
- Provides clear path for necessary transfers
- Aligns with blue-chip DeFi patterns
- Keeps implementation simple and auditable

The 50% penalty on emergency exit is harsh but necessary to maintain system incentives. Users who truly need to transfer will accept the cost.
