# RDAT Fixed Supply Migration

## Overview
This document summarizes the migration from a mintable RDAT token to a fixed supply model where all 100M tokens are minted at deployment.

## Key Changes

### 1. RDATUpgradeable Contract
- **Initialize Function**: Now takes 3 parameters: `treasury`, `admin`, `migrationContract`
- **Supply Distribution**: 
  - 70M tokens minted to treasury
  - 30M tokens minted to migration contract
  - Total 100M supply minted at deployment
- **Minting**: `mint()` function always reverts with "Minting is disabled - all tokens minted at deployment"
- **No MINTER_ROLE**: Role completely removed from the contract

### 2. StakingPositions Contract
- **No Reward Minting**: Removed all RDAT minting logic
- **_claimRewards()**: Now reverts with "Use RewardsManager for claiming"
- **_calculateRewards()**: Returns 0 (deprecated)
- **Rewards**: All rewards come from pre-allocated pools via RewardsManager

### 3. Migration Contract Design
- Receives 30M tokens at RDAT deployment
- Cannot mint new tokens (no special privileges)
- Only transfers its balance to V1 holders
- Auditable on-chain balance
- Can implement deadline for unclaimed tokens

### 4. Test Updates
All test files updated to reflect:
- 3-parameter initialization for RDAT
- No MINTER_ROLE grants
- No rdat.mint() calls - replaced with treasury transfers
- Fixed supply expectations in assertions

### 5. Documentation Updates
- SPECIFICATIONS.md: Added tokenomics section and deployment process
- TECHNICAL_FAQ.md: Added comprehensive Q&As about fixed supply
- CONTRACTS_SPEC.md: Updated contract specifications
- WHITEPAPER.md: Updated tokenomics section

## Security Improvements
1. **No Infinite Mint Bug**: Impossible to mint beyond 100M
2. **No Minting Attack Vectors**: Eliminates entire class of vulnerabilities
3. **Simpler Contract**: Fewer functions = smaller attack surface
4. **Immutable Supply**: Token holders protected from dilution

## Testing Status
- [x] RDAT initialization tests passing
- [x] Fixed supply distribution verified
- [x] Mint function correctly reverts
- [ ] Full test suite validation pending

## Migration Checklist
- [x] Update RDATUpgradeable contract
- [x] Remove minting from StakingPositions
- [x] Update all test files
- [x] Update documentation
- [ ] Deploy and verify on testnet
- [ ] Security audit of changes
- [ ] Deploy to mainnet

## Breaking Changes
1. Any contract expecting to mint RDAT will fail
2. Migration contract must be deployed before RDAT
3. Treasury must have distribution plan for 70M tokens
4. No future minting possible - must deploy new contract if needed
