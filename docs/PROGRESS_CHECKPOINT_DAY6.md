# Progress Checkpoint - Day 6

## Date: 2025-01-06

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Migration System Complete ✅
- Implemented BaseMigrationBridge for Base chain (burns V1 tokens)
- Implemented VanaMigrationBridge for Vana chain (releases V2 tokens)
- Added multi-validator consensus mechanism (3+ validators, 2-of-3 minimum)
- Implemented 6-hour challenge period for security
- Created separate MigrationBonusVesting contract for 12-month bonus vesting
- Time-based migration incentives: 5% (week 1-2), 3% (week 3-4), 1% (month 2), 0% (after)

### 2. Revenue Distribution Enhanced ✅
- Updated RevenueCollector with dynamic token support
- Integrated RewardsManager for flexible reward distribution
- Implemented intelligent routing:
  - Supported tokens: 50/30/20 distribution (stakers/treasury/contributors)
  - Unsupported tokens: 100% to treasury (awaiting DAO decision)
- Added `isTokenSupported()` to RewardsManager for dynamic checking

### 3. Testing & Deployment ✅
- Ran comprehensive test suite: 297/339 tests passing (87.6%)
- Successfully deployed full system to local chains
- Completed testnet deployment simulations
- Completed mainnet deployment simulations
- Created deployment verification scripts

### 4. Code Cleanup ✅
- Removed entire `src_old/` directory (V1 implementations)
- Removed test Counter contracts and scripts
- Cleaned up backup files
- Streamlined codebase to contain only V2 implementation

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Migration Bonus Separation**: Based on user feedback, separated migration reserve (30M for 1:1 exchange) from bonus allocations to prevent depletion
2. **Dynamic Token Support**: RevenueCollector now queries RewardsManager to determine supported tokens rather than hardcoding
3. **Deployment Strategy**: Created sequential deployment scripts to handle contract dependencies properly
4. **Local Testing**: Set up multi-chain Anvil environment for comprehensive testing

### Deployment Readiness
- ✅ Vana Moksha testnet: Ready (sufficient balance)
- ✅ Base Sepolia testnet: Ready (sufficient balance)
- ✅ Base mainnet: Ready (sufficient balance)
- ⚠️ Vana mainnet: Needs balance top-up (only 0.099 VANA)

## Remaining High Priority Tasks

1. **Complete RewardsManager Integration**: Fix integration with StakingPositions to enable full reward distribution
2. **ProofOfContribution**: Implement Vana DLP integration
3. **Final Test Fixes**: Address remaining test compilation errors

## Key Metrics
- **Contracts Implemented**: 13/16 (81%)
- **Test Coverage**: 87.6% passing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive specs, deployment guides, and architecture docs
- **Deployment Scripts**: Complete for all environments

## Git Commits Created
1. `feat: implement cross-chain migration system with bonus vesting`
2. `feat: complete deployment simulations and local chain deployment`
3. `chore: clean up deprecated and outdated files`

## Next Steps
1. Complete RewardsManager integration with StakingPositions
2. Implement ProofOfContribution for Vana DLP compliance
3. Fix remaining test issues
4. Deploy to testnets for live testing
5. Prepare for mainnet deployment
