- **Additional Buffer**: 5-6 days for enhanced security

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations

1. **Maintain current velocity** - Team is performing exceptionally
2. **Use extra time for security** - Not feature additions
3. **Begin auditor coordination** - May start 2 days early
4. **Prepare bug bounty program** - Launch with audit

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- **Day 2-3**: Complete remaining core contracts
- **Day 4**: Integration testing
- **Day 5-6**: Security hardening
- **Day 7**: Begin audit (2 days early)

## âœ… Risk Mitigation

The implementation of upgradeability on Day 1 provides:
- Ability to fix critical bugs post-deployment
- No need for token migration if issues found
- Reduced pressure on audit timeline
- Insurance against unforeseen issues

## ðŸ“ž Action Required

No immediate action required. Development proceeding ahead of schedule with reduced risk profile.
