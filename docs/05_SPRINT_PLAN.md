**Last Updated**: August 7, 2025
**Sprint Days Remaining**: 12
**Current Phase**: Stabilization & Planning
**Next Milestone**: Audit Preparation (Days 8-9)# 📅 Sprint 2 Roadmap: VRC-20 Compliance & Pre-Audit Preparation

**Sprint Duration**: 21 days (Extended by 1 week)  
**Start Date**: December 20, 2024  
**End Date**: January 10, 2025  
**Sprint Goal**: Achieve full VRC-20 compliance BEFORE audit to ensure clean audit results

## 🔄 Major Changes from Original Plan

### Timeline Adjustments
- **Sprint extended**: 14 days → 21 days
- **Audit postponed**: Now scheduled for January 11, 2025
- **VRC-20 compliance**: Moved from "post-audit" to "pre-audit" priority

### Rationale for Changes
1. **Audit efficiency**: Better to audit compliant code than fix compliance after
2. **Cost savings**: One audit vs. audit + re-audit for compliance
3. **Risk reduction**: Avoid deployment delays due to non-compliance
4. **DLP eligibility**: Can register immediately after mainnet launch

## Priority Levels

- 🔴 **P0 (Blocker)**: Must complete before audit
- 🟡 **P1 (Critical)**: Must complete before mainnet  
- 🟢 **P2 (Important)**: Can complete post-mainnet
