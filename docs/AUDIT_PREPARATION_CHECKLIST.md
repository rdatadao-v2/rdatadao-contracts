# Audit Preparation Checklist

*Target Audit Date: August 11, 2025*
*Current Date: August 7, 2025*
*Days Remaining: 4*

## Executive Summary

Current Status: **NEARLY READY** 
- Core Implementation: ✅ COMPLETE (356/356 tests passing)
- Documentation: ⚠️ NEEDS ALIGNMENT 
- VRC-20: ✅ MINIMAL COMPLIANCE ACHIEVED
- Security: ✅ READY

## Pre-Audit Checklist

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Complete (By Aug 8)

#### Documentation Fixes
- [ ] Fix contract count inconsistency (11 vs 14)
  - Update SPECIFICATIONS.md to show 11 core contracts
  - Update MASTER_REFERENCE.md to match
  
- [ ] Clarify VRC-20 compliance level
  - Document Option B (minimal) as current state
  - Update all references to "full compliance" to "minimal compliance"
  - Add note about post-audit full implementation

- [ ] Fix RDAT vs vRDAT minting documentation
  - RDAT: Fixed 100M, no minting ever
  - vRDAT: Unlimited minting for rewards
  
- [ ] Update isVRC20Compliant() function
  ```solidity
  // Change to:
  function isVRC20MinimallyCompliant() returns (bool)
  ```

#### Code Fixes
- [ ] Verify all 356 tests still pass
  ```bash
  forge test
  ```

- [ ] Run Slither analysis
  ```bash
  slither . --exclude naming-convention,external-function,timestamp
  ```

- [ ] Check deployment scripts work
  ```bash
  ./script/anvil-multichain.sh start
  forge script script/DeployTestnets.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8546
  ```

### 🟡 IMPORTANT - Should Complete (By Aug 9)

#### Documentation Package
- [ ] Update AUDIT_SPECIFICATIONS.md with:
  - Current VRC-20 status (minimal compliance)
  - List of deferred features
  - Security assumptions
  
- [ ] Create KNOWN_ISSUES.md documenting:
  - Circular dependency workaround
  - Manual migration bridge process
  - VRC-20 features not yet implemented
  
- [ ] Update TECHNICAL_FAQ.md with:
  - Audit-specific questions
  - Deployment procedures
  - Emergency response plans

#### Testing Documentation
- [ ] Generate coverage report
  ```bash
  forge coverage --report lcov
  forge coverage --report summary > docs/COVERAGE_REPORT.txt
  ```

- [ ] Document test categories
  ```markdown
  Unit Tests: 230+ tests
  Integration Tests: 80+ tests
  Security Tests: 30+ tests
  VRC-20 Tests: 23 tests
  Total: 356 tests (100% passing)
  ```

#### Security Review
- [ ] Document all external calls
- [ ] List all admin functions
- [ ] Map upgrade paths and timelocks
- [ ] Verify reentrancy protection

### 🟢 NICE TO HAVE - If Time Permits (By Aug 10)

#### Code Quality
- [ ] Add missing NatSpec comments
- [ ] Replace magic numbers with constants
- [ ] Standardize error messages
- [ ] Remove commented code

#### Gas Optimization
- [ ] Cache array lengths
- [ ] Optimize storage reads
- [ ] Review loop efficiency

#### Additional Tests
- [ ] Cross-chain migration simulation
- [ ] Emergency pause scenarios
- [ ] Upgrade simulations

## Security Checklist

### Access Control
- [x] Multi-sig addresses documented
- [x] Role assignments verified
- [x] Admin functions protected
- [x] Upgrade paths controlled

### Common Vulnerabilities
- [x] Reentrancy protection
- [x] Integer overflow (Solidity 0.8.23)
- [x] Front-running mitigation
- [x] Flash loan attacks considered

### Emergency Procedures
- [x] 72-hour pause mechanism
- [x] Emergency withdrawal (50% penalty)
- [x] Upgrade timelocks (48 hours)
- [ ] Document response procedures

## Deployment Verification

### Testnet Deployments
- [x] Local Anvil (Vana) - Success
- [x] Local Anvil (Base) - Success
- [ ] Vana Moksha testnet
- [ ] Base Sepolia testnet

### Configuration Verification
- [x] Supply distribution (70M/30M)
- [x] Multi-sig addresses
- [x] Lock periods and multipliers
- [x] VRC-20 minimal features

## Known Issues to Disclose

### Acknowledged Limitations
1. **VRC-20 Partial Implementation**
   - Only minimal compliance (Option B)
   - Full features planned post-audit (10-12 weeks)

2. **Manual Migration Bridge**
   - Requires off-chain relay between Base and Vana
   - Validator network provides security

3. **Placeholder Contracts**
   - ProofOfContributionStub is interface only
   - DLP Registry not connected to Vana

### Accepted Risks
1. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Resolved with placeholder addresses
   - CREATE2 solution documented but not implemented

2. **Gas Optimization**
   - Not fully optimized
   - Post-audit optimization planned

## Final Verification Steps

### Day Before Audit (Aug 10)
- [ ] Final test run (all 356 tests)
- [ ] Clean build verification
- [ ] Documentation spell check
- [ ] Remove debug code

  git push origin v2.0.0-audit
  ```

### Audit Day (Aug 11)
