# Code Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-01-06

### Files Removed

1. **Entire `src_old/` directory** - Contained all V1 contract implementations:
   - Old base contracts
   - Old staking system (StakingManager.sol)
   - Old reward system
   - Old vesting contracts
   - Old interfaces
   - Old multi-chain approach

2. **Test/Example Contracts**:
   - `src/Counter.sol` - Simple test contract
   - `test/Counter.t.sol` - Counter test file
   - `script/Counter.s.sol` - Counter script
   - `script/DeployCounter.s.sol` - Counter deployment
   - `script/base/DeployCounter.s.sol` - Base Counter deployment
   - `script/vana/DeployCounter.s.sol` - Vana Counter deployment

3. **Backup Files**:
   - `src/interfaces/IMigrationBridge.sol.bak` - Backup interface file

### Why These Were Removed

- **src_old/**: Complete V1 architecture that has been superseded by V2
- **Counter files**: Test contracts used only for deployment verification
- **Backup files**: No longer needed with git version control

### Files Kept

- All files in main `src/` directory (current V2 implementation)
- All active test files in `test/`
- All deployment scripts for the actual system
- Example contracts in `src/examples/` (educational value)

### Result

The codebase is now cleaner and contains only the active V2 implementation, reducing confusion and making it easier to navigate the current architecture.
