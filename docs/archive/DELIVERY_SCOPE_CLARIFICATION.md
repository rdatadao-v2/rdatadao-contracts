2. **vRDAT**: Soul-bound governance token
3. **EmergencyPause**: Shared emergency system with 72-hour expiry

### Staking System ✅
1. **StakingPositions**: NFT-based staking with time-lock multipliers
   - Lock periods: 30, 90, 180, 365 days
   - Multipliers: 1x, 1.15x, 1.35x, 1.75x
   - Position limit: 100 per user
   - Minimum stake: 1 RDAT

### Migration Infrastructure ✅
1. **BaseMigrationBridge**: Burns V1 tokens on Base
2. **VanaMigrationBridge**: Issues V2 tokens on Vana
3. **MigrationBonusVesting**: 12-month vesting for bonus tokens
   - 2-of-3 validator consensus
   - Daily limits enforced
   - 90-day migration window

### Financial Contracts ✅
1. **TreasuryWallet**: Manages token allocations and vesting
2. **TokenVesting**: Generic vesting contract for team/advisors
3. **RevenueCollector**: 50/30/20 fee distribution mechanism

### Rewards System (Partially Active) ⚠️
1. **RewardsManager**: ✅ Orchestrator for modular rewards
2. **vRDATRewardModule**: ✅ Active - mints vRDAT on stake
3. **RDATRewardModule**: ❌ Built but inactive (Phase 3)
4. **VRC14LiquidityModule**: ❌ Built but inactive (Phase 2)

### Supporting Infrastructure ✅
1. **Create2Factory**: Deterministic deployment addresses
2. **ProofOfContributionStub**: Vana compliance placeholder

**Total Active Contracts**: 13
**Total Tests Passing**: 333/333

## 🏗️ What's Built But Not Active

### Governance System 🔄
**Status**: Fully implemented, not integrated
1. **GovernanceCore**: Proposal management
2. **GovernanceVoting**: Quadratic voting with vRDAT burning
3. **GovernanceExecution**: Timelock execution

**Why Not Active**: 
- Reduces audit surface area
- Allows focused testing post-audit
- Snapshot voting works for initial phase

### Reward Modules 🔄
1. **RDATRewardModule**: Time-based RDAT rewards
2. **VRC14LiquidityModule**: Liquidity incentives

**Why Not Active**:
- Requires treasury allocation approval
- Phase 3 activation planned
- Reduces complexity for audit

## 📋 What's Documented But Not Built

### Phase 3 Features 📝
1. **On-chain Phase 3 activation voting**: Currently multi-sig controlled
2. **Full VRC-14/15 compliance**: Only stubs implemented
3. **Automated reward distribution**: Manual process for now
4. **Advanced governance features**: Delegation, time-weighted voting

### Phase 2 Features 📝
1. **Liquid staking derivatives**
2. **Reality.eth integration**
3. **Kismet score registry**
4. **Data marketplace**

## 🎨 Architecture Decisions Explained

### Why Governance Isn't Integrated
1. **Risk Reduction**: Simpler audit surface
2. **Flexibility**: Can modify based on audit feedback
3. **Timeline**: Snapshot works for immediate needs
4. **Testing**: More time for community testing

### Why Fixed Supply Model
1. **Security**: No minting vulnerabilities
2. **Simplicity**: Easier to audit and understand
3. **Trust**: Clear tokenomics for holders
4. **Sustainability**: Forces careful treasury management

### Why Modular Rewards
1. **Flexibility**: Add rewards without touching staking
2. **Security**: Immutable staking, upgradeable rewards
3. **Efficiency**: Gas optimization through separation
4. **Future-proof**: Easy to add partner rewards

## 🚀 Activation Timeline

### Immediate (At Deployment)
- ✅ Token transfers
- ✅ Staking/unstaking
- ✅ vRDAT minting
- ✅ Migration from V1
- ✅ Emergency pause

### Post-Audit (Days 14-18)
- 🔄 Governance integration
- 🔄 Additional testing
- 🔄 Documentation updates

### Phase 2 (Months 2-4)
- 📋 Liquidity module activation
- 📋 Enhanced VRC compliance
- 📋 Bridge decentralization

### Phase 3 (Month 5+)
- 📋 RDAT reward distribution
- 📋 30M token unlock
- 📋 Full governance activation

## ✅ Audit Focus Areas

### Priority 1: Security Critical
1. Token minting prevention
2. Staking/unstaking logic
3. Migration security
4. Access control

### Priority 2: Economic Critical
1. Multiplier calculations
2. vRDAT distribution
3. Treasury allocations
4. Fee distribution

### Priority 3: Operational
1. Emergency pause
2. Upgrade mechanisms
3. Role management

## 🔒 Security Guarantees

### What We Guarantee
1. **No minting**: Supply fixed at 100M forever
2. **No rug pulls**: Multi-sig controlled, time-locked
3. **No flash loans**: vRDAT is soul-bound
4. **Position safety**: NFTs prevent manipulation

### Known Limitations
1. **Gas costs**: Position enumeration expensive at scale
2. **Centralization**: Initial validators team-controlled
3. **Governance**: Currently off-chain via Snapshot

## 📊 Success Metrics

### For Audit Success
- Zero critical vulnerabilities
- Zero high-risk issues
- Gas costs within reasonable limits
- Clear upgrade path

### For Launch Success
- Successful V1→V2 migration
- Staking participation >20%
- No emergency pause needed
- Community satisfaction

## 🎯 Key Messages

### For Auditors
"We've built a robust, modular system with clear separation of concerns. Some advanced features are built but intentionally not activated to reduce audit complexity."

### For Community
"Core functionality is 100% complete and tested. Advanced features will roll out in phases after thorough testing and community approval."

### For Team
"We've over-delivered on architecture while maintaining focus on security. Post-audit integration will be straightforward."
