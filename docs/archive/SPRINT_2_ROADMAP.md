# Sprint 2 Roadmap: VRC-20 Compliance Pre-Audit Sprint

**Sprint Duration**: 11 days (remaining)  
**Start Date**: August 7, 2025 (TODAY)  
**End Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Sprint Goal**: Implement essential VRC-20 compliance features BEFORE audit to ensure DLP eligibility

## Sprint Overview

This sprint focuses on rapid VRC-20 compliance implementation:
1. **Blocklisting System** - Required for VRC-20 (Days 3-4)
