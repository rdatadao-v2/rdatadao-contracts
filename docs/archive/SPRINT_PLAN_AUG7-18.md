## 🎯 Key Deliverables by Priority

### P0 - Must Have (Blocking)
1. ✅ All core contracts working
2. ✅ 100% critical path test coverage
3. Security audit pass (Days 12-13)
4. Testnet deployments verified
5. Audit fixes implemented

### P1 - Should Have (Important)
1. Gas optimization improvements
2. Integration test suite
3. Deployment automation
4. Monitoring setup
5. Incident response plan

### P2 - Nice to Have (If Time)
1. Additional documentation
2. Frontend integration guides
3. Community testing program
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Additional deployment tools

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Known Risks
1. **Gas Costs**: Position enumeration expensive at scale
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination or off-chain indexing
   
2. **Audit Findings**: Unknown critical issues
   - **Mitigation**: 2-day buffer for fixes, team on standby

3. **Cross-chain Complexity**: Migration edge cases
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive integration testing Days 10-11

4. **Deployment Risks**: Mainnet deployment issues
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple testnet dry-runs, runbooks

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Sprint Success Criteria
- [ ] Security audit passed with no critical issues
- [ ] All high/critical audit findings resolved
- [ ] Successful testnet deployments on both chains
- [ ] 100% test coverage maintained
- [ ] Gas costs within acceptable limits (<500k for common operations)
- [ ] Documentation complete and approved
- [ ] Team confident in mainnet deployment

### Daily Standup Focus Areas
1. **Blockers**: What's preventing progress?
2. **Audit Prep**: Are we ready for Day 12?
3. **Testing**: What scenarios need coverage?
4. **Documentation**: What's missing?
5. **Deployment**: Are scripts ready?

## 🔄 Contingency Plans

### If Audit Finds Critical Issues
- Days 14-15 become critical fix days
- Delay non-critical work to Day 16-17
- Consider sprint extension if needed

### If Gas Optimization Fails
- Document as known limitation
- Plan Phase 2 optimization sprint
- Implement workarounds (pagination, limits)

### If Integration Tests Reveal Issues
- Prioritize fixes over new features
- Focus on core functionality
- Document limitations clearly

## 📝 Daily Checklist

### Every Day
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Check for new security advisories
- [ ] Update sprint tracking document
- [ ] Communicate blockers immediately
- [ ] Commit code with clear messages

### Before Audit (Day 11)
