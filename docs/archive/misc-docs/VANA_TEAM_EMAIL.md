**To:** Vana Development Team  
**From:** r/datadao Core Team  
**Subject:** Manual DLP Registration Request - r/datadao (Multiple Automated Attempts Failed)

Dear Vana Team,

We are the core development team behind **r/datadao**, a Reddit-focused Data DAO that has successfully deployed a comprehensive tokenomics system on Vana Moksha testnet. We're requesting manual assistance with DLP registration after encountering persistent failures with the automated registry system.

## Project Overview

**r/datadao** is a production-ready Data DAO implementing cross-chain token migration from Base to Vana with a 100M fixed-supply token model. We've completed extensive development, testing (373 tests passing), and audit preparation specifically targeting the Vana ecosystem.

**Key Stats:**
- **Repository:** https://github.com/nissan/rdatadao-contracts
- **Total Supply:** 100M RDAT tokens (fixed, no minting)  
- **Test Coverage:** 100% (373/373 tests passing)
- **Security:** Audit-ready with comprehensive testing
- **Focus:** Reddit data contribution and validation

## Deployed Infrastructure (Vana Moksha Testnet)

All core systems are fully deployed and operational:

```
RDAT Token:         0xEb0c43d5987de0672A22e350930F615Af646e28c
Treasury:           0x31C3e3F091FB2A25d4dac82474e7dc709adE754a (70M RDAT)
Migration Bridge:   0xdCa8b322c11515A3B5e6e806170b573bDe179328 (30M RDAT)
DLP Contract:       0xC1aC75130533c7F93BDa67f6645De65C9DEE9a3A
Multisig:           0x29CeA936835D189BD5BEBA80Fe091f1Da29aA319
```

## Registration Attempts & Technical Details

We've made multiple systematic attempts to register our DLP through the official registry at `0x4D59880a924526d1dD33260552Ff4328b1E18a43`, all resulting in identical revert patterns:

### Attempt 1: Custom DLP Implementation
- **Contract:** `0x254A9344AAb674530D47B6F2dDd8e328A17Da860` (RDATDataDAO)
- **Approach:** Full-featured data contribution and validation system
- **Result:** Registration reverted with empty revert data
- **Trace Pattern:**
  ```
  registerDlp{value: 1 VANA}(...)
  ├─ [delegatecall] 0x72bA0c4DF3122e8aACe5066443eEb33B0491909C::registerDlp(...)
  │   └─ ← [Revert] EvmError: Revert
  ```

### Attempt 2: Simplified Vana-Compatible DLP  
- **Contract:** `0xC1aC75130533c7F93BDa67f6645De65C9DEE9a3A` (SimpleVanaDLP)
- **Approach:** Minimal implementation matching expected interfaces
- **Features:** UUPS upgradeable, AccessControl, file rewards, contributor tracking
- **Result:** Identical revert pattern as Attempt 1
- **Code:** Available at `src/SimpleVanaDLP.sol` in our repository

### Attempt 3: Direct Token Registration (Initial Test)
- **Contract:** RDAT Token address directly
- **Result:** Expected failure (not a DLP contract)
- **Learning:** Confirmed registry expects DLP-specific interfaces

## Error Analysis

**Consistent Failure Pattern:**
- All attempts fail at identical point in registry implementation
- Empty revert data suggests validation failure rather than execution error
- Same gas consumption (1422) and trace pattern across all attempts
- Registry proxy (`0x4D59880a924526d1dD33260552Ff4328b1E18a43`) delegates to implementation (`0x72bA0c4DF3122e8aACe5066443eEb33B0491909C`)

**Hypotheses:**
1. **Whitelist Requirement:** Registry may require pre-approval for testnet
2. **Hidden Validation:** Undocumented interface or integration requirements
3. **DataRegistry Integration:** May require specific DataRegistry contract calls
4. **TEE Pool Integration:** May require active TEE Pool interactions
5. **Epoch Timing:** Registration may be restricted to specific time windows

## Technical Implementation Details

## Request for Manual Registration

Given the consistent automated failures and our production-ready system, we respectfully request **manual DLP registration** with the following details:

### Registration Information
- **DLP Name:** `r/datadao`
- **DLP Address:** `0xC1aC75130533c7F93BDa67f6645De65C9DEE9a3A`
- **Owner Address:** `0x29CeA936835D189BD5BEBA80Fe091f1Da29aA319` (3/5 multisig)
- **Treasury Address:** `0x29CeA936835D189BD5BEBA80Fe091f1Da29aA319` (same as owner)
- **Website:** https://rdatadao.org
- **Icon URL:** https://rdatadao.org/logo.png
- **Metadata:** Reddit Data DAO - Social Media Data Liquidity Pool v2.0
- **Registration Fee:** 1 VANA (ready to pay via multisig)

### Additional Context
- **Focus:** Reddit data contribution, validation, and monetization
- **Community:** Active Reddit community with proven engagement
- **Token Model:** Fixed 100M supply with cross-chain migration from Base
- **Security:** Comprehensive testing and audit preparation
- **Integration Ready:** Can integrate with DataRegistry and TEE Pool once registered

## Questions for Vana Team

1. **Validation Requirements:** Are there specific interface methods or integration requirements not documented publicly?

2. **Whitelist Process:** Does testnet DLP registration require pre-approval or whitelist inclusion?

3. **Integration Dependencies:** Must DLPs actively use DataRegistry and TEE Pool before registration?

4. **Timing Constraints:** Are there specific epochs or time windows when registration is allowed?

5. **Official Template:** Should we use the exact Hardhat deployment process from vana-smart-contracts repository?

6. **Debug Assistance:** Can you provide insight into what validation is failing in our registration attempts?

## Next Steps

We're eager to complete our Vana ecosystem integration and would appreciate:

1. **Manual registration** of our DLP with the provided details
2. **Guidance** on automated registration requirements for future deployments  
3. **Documentation** of any missing requirements or integration steps
4. **Timeline** for resolution and mainnet preparation

**P.S.** Our core tokenomics and cross-chain migration systems are fully operational regardless of DLP registration status, but official Vana ecosystem integration would greatly enhance our community's experience and align with our technical roadmap.
