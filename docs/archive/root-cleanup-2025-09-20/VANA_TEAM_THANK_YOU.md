# Thank You to the Vana Team - DLP Registration Successful!

Dear Vana Team,

We wanted to express our sincere gratitude for your precise technical assistance with our DLP registration issue. Your feedback was exactly what we needed to resolve the problem quickly.

## What We Were Doing Wrong

You correctly identified that our transactions were calling a non-existent method with selector `0x5fa868f6` instead of the correct `registerDlp` function with selector `0x9d4def70`.

### The Issue
We were using a custom Foundry script with an **incorrect ABI definition**. Our interface defined `registerDlp` with individual parameters:

```solidity
// ❌ INCORRECT - What we were using
function registerDlp(
    address dlpAddress,
    address ownerAddress,
    address treasuryAddress,
    string calldata name,
    string calldata iconUrl,
    string calldata website,
    string calldata metadata
) external payable;
// This generates selector: 0x5fa868f6
```

### The Solution
Thanks to your feedback about the function selector mismatch, we discovered that the correct interface uses a **struct parameter**:

```solidity
// ✅ CORRECT - What the registry actually expects
struct DLPInfo {
    address dlpAddress;
    address ownerAddress;
    address treasuryAddress;
    string name;
    string iconUrl;
    string website;
    string metadata;
}

function registerDlp(DLPInfo calldata dlpInfo) external payable;
// This generates selector: 0x9d4def70
```

## Registration Success

After correcting our script's interface definition, the registration worked perfectly:

- **DLP Name**: r/datadao
- **DLP ID**: 155
- **Contract**: `0x32B481b52616044E5c937CF6D20204564AD62164`
- **Network**: Vana Moksha Testnet

## Key Takeaways

1. **Function signatures matter**: The difference between passing individual parameters vs. a struct creates completely different function selectors
2. **Transaction analysis is invaluable**: Your observation of the transaction input data immediately pinpointed the issue
3. **Struct-based parameters**: Modern Solidity contracts often use structs for cleaner interfaces and better gas efficiency

## Technical Details for Other Developers

For anyone else encountering similar issues:

- Always verify function selectors match when integrating with external contracts
- Use `cast sig "functionName(paramTypes)"` to calculate selectors
- Remember that `(type1,type2,type3)` in a function signature indicates a tuple/struct parameter
- When ABI documentation isn't available, analyze successful transactions to reverse-engineer the interface

## Moving Forward

We're now successfully integrated with the Vana DLP ecosystem and excited to:
- Enable Reddit data contributions through our DLP
- Distribute rewards to data contributors
- Participate in the broader Vana data economy

Thank you again for your quick and precise technical support. The clarity of your feedback - especially providing the exact function selectors - made debugging this issue straightforward.

Best regards,
The r/datadao Team
