# Base Network Deployment Gas Estimates

## Summary

**You're right - 0.05 ETH is WAY too much!**

The Base network deployment only requires deploying a single `BaseMigrationBridge` contract, which costs:
- **At typical Base gas prices (0.1 gwei)**: ~0.0001 ETH
- **At high congestion (2 gwei)**: ~0.0022 ETH
- **Worst case scenario (10 gwei)**: ~0.011 ETH

## Detailed Gas Analysis

### Contract to Deploy
```
BaseMigrationBridge
├── Gas Used: 1,108,320
├── Contract Size: 5.268 KB
└── Complexity: Medium (uses AccessControl, Pausable, ReentrancyGuard)
```

### Cost Breakdown by Gas Price

| Gas Price | Deployment Cost | Network Condition |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 0.01 gwei | 0.000011 ETH | Very Low (off-peak) |
| 0.05 gwei | 0.000055 ETH | Low |
| 0.10 gwei | 0.000111 ETH | **Typical Base** |
| 0.50 gwei | 0.000554 ETH | Medium |
| 1.00 gwei | 0.001108 ETH | High |
| 2.00 gwei | 0.002217 ETH | Very High |
| 5.00 gwei | 0.005542 ETH | Congested |
| 10.00 gwei | 0.011083 ETH | Peak Congestion |

## Base Network Gas Price Context

Base is an L2 (Layer 2) network with significantly lower gas costs than Ethereum mainnet:

### Typical Base Gas Prices
- **Low Priority**: 0.01-0.05 gwei
- **Medium Priority**: 0.05-0.5 gwei
- **High Priority**: 0.5-2 gwei
- **Peak/Congested**: 2-10 gwei (rare)

### For Comparison
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: 10-100 gwei (typical)
- **Base L2**: 0.01-2 gwei (typical)

## Recommended Budget

### For Base Deployment

**Current Balance**: 0.00499 ETH

**Recommended**:
- **Minimum needed**: 0.002 ETH (safe for deployment + buffer)
- **Comfortable budget**: 0.005 ETH (your current balance is actually sufficient!)

### Updated Funding Requirements

```bash
# Deployer: 0x58eCB94e6F5e6521228316b55c465ad2A2938FbB

# Base Mainnet
Current: 0.00499 ETH ✅ SUFFICIENT
Needed: None (current balance covers deployment)

# Vana Mainnet
Current: 0.099 VANA ❌ INSUFFICIENT
Needed: Send 2 VANA for deployment + DLP registration
```

## Deployment Commands with Gas Settings

### Base Mainnet Deployment

```bash
# Deploy with explicit gas price (recommended)
forge script script/DeployBaseMigration.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --with-gas-price 100000000 \  # 0.1 gwei in wei
  --verify

# Or let it auto-detect (usually fine on Base)
forge script script/DeployBaseMigration.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $BASE_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --private-key $DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY \
  --verify
```

## What Gets Deployed on Base

The Base deployment is minimal - just one contract:

1. **BaseMigrationBridge.sol**
   - Accepts V1 RDAT tokens
   - Burns them (sends to 0xdEaD)
   - Emits events for validators
   - No token minting (happens on Vana side)

## Cost Comparison

| Network | Contract | Gas Used | Cost @ Typical | Cost @ High |
|---------|----------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Base | Migration Bridge | 1.1M | 0.0001 ETH | 0.002 ETH |
| Vana | Full System | ~5M | 0.5 VANA | 1 VANA |
| Ethereum | (For reference) | 1.1M | 0.022 ETH | 0.11 ETH |

## Conclusion

**Good news!** Your current Base balance of **0.00499 ETH is sufficient** for deployment. The 0.05 ETH estimate was overly conservative. Base L2 gas costs are typically 100-1000x cheaper than Ethereum mainnet.

### Action Required:
- ✅ Base: No additional funding needed
- ❌ Vana: Still need ~2 VANA for deployment
