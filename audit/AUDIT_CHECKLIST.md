- [x] Integration tests: Cross-contract interactions
- [x] Fuzz tests: Property-based testing
- [x] Invariant tests: Critical properties maintained
- [x] Security tests: Attack vector simulations
- [x] Gas optimization: Snapshot comparisons

### Static Analysis
- [x] Slither analysis completed
- [x] Mythril symbolic execution
- [x] Foundry security checks
- [x] Manual code review
- [x] No high/critical findings unresolved

### Emergency Response
- [x] 72-hour pause with auto-expiry
- [x] Multi-pauser support (2/5 threshold)
- [x] Guardian role for emergency unpause
- [x] Incident response plan documented
- [x] Emergency contacts established

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Acknowledged Risks

### Centralization Risks
- [ ] Oracle for cross-chain migration (single point of failure)
- [ ] Multisig control of critical functions
- [ ] Upgrade capability on core contracts
- [ ] Admin control of pause mechanism

### Economic Risks
- [ ] Large treasury allocation (70% of supply)
- [ ] Vesting schedule modifications possible
- [ ] Reward distribution parameters adjustable
- [ ] Market manipulation via large positions

### Technical Debt
- [ ] ProofOfContribution is stub implementation
- [ ] Oracle implementation not decentralized
- [ ] Some test scenarios incomplete
- [ ] Gas optimization opportunities remain
